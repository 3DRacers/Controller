# 3DRacers Controller

The Arduino-powered controller for a 3DRacers.

This project is actually unsupported by the main development of 3DRacers, while exhist some valid alternatives:

 - A Bluetooth HID generic controller (like the cheap Android/iOS controllers available on the market)
 - A Bluetooth HID Arduino board like the Adafruit Bluefruit EZ-Key or the RedBearLab Blend Micro
 - A 3D printed remote attached to your smartphone
